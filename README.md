# 👋 Hi, welcome!  

**I build robust AI & LLM retrieval systems — from research prototypes to production-ready pipelines.**  

- Software Engineer & Applied AI, focused on **language models, vector search & information retrieval**.  
- Passionate about making **reliable, reproducible ML pipelines**: containerization, monitoring, logging, guardrails & fallbacks.  
- Always exploring the frontier between **theory and practice**: from differential geometry & topology to explainable AI, RL, and game theory.  

> (Also up for a chess or poker game!)

## Expertise
- **Legal/Healthcare Search & Re-Ranking** Hybrid & Dense Embeddings. Elasticsearch, Solr, Vespa. RRE & Quepid
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** built [rag-prototype](https://github.com/Intrinsical-AI/rag-prototype) — agents & LLM apps.  
- **Infrastructure:** deliver production-ready APIs & services with Docker, FastAPI, CI/CD, and reproducible pipelines.
- **OpenSource:** OS Search, OSINT. Tools, Prompting & Docs: [LM-Stacks](https://github.com/Intrinsical-AI/LM-Stacks), [RepoGPT](https://github.com/MrCabss69/RepoGPT)
- **LLM-consensous, query expansion, and synthetic-data generation**
- **Game-Theory RL:** apply MCTS, CFR/DeepCFR, and Regret Matching to games research.
