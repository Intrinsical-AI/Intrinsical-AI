# 👋 Hi, I'm Pablo  

**I build robust AI & LLM retrieval systems — from research prototypes to production-ready pipelines.**  

- Software Engineer & Applied AI, focused on **language models, vector search & information retrieval**.  
- Passionate about making **reliable, reproducible ML pipelines**: containerization, monitoring, logging, guardrails & fallbacks.  
- Always exploring the frontier between **theory and practice**: from differential geometry & topology to explainable AI, RL, and game theory.

## 🔹 What I Do  

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Built [rag-prototype](https://github.com/Intrinsical-AI/rag-prototype) — dense retrieval & LLM apps.  
- **Game-Theory RL:** Previously applied MCTS, CFR/DeepCFR, and Regret Matching to games research.  
- **Infrastructure:** Deliver production-ready APIs & services with Docker, FastAPI, CI/CD, and reproducible pipelines.  
- **Tools, Prompting & Docs:** [LM-Stacks](https://github.com/Intrinsical-AI/LM-Stacks), [RepoGPT](https://github.com/MrCabss69/RepoGPT)
---

## 🔹 How I Can Help  

- Designing and deploying **search & retrieval pipelines** at scale  
- Building **LLM-powered applications** with solid guardrails and reproducibility  
- Bringing **research ideas into production** without losing rigor  
- Collaborating on **open-source, ML infra or retrieval problems**
